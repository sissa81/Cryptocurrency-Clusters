# Cryptocurrency-Clusters

## Background

* Through unsupervised machine learning analyze and report on what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and determine whether they can be grouped to create a classification system using a dataset from [CryptoCompare](https://min-api.cryptocompare.com/data/all/coinlist).

## Process

### Data Preparation: 

* Exclude cryptocurrency that is not being traded, or has not been mined. 
* Convert text values to numerical data and standardize the dataset.

### Dimensionality Reduction: 
* Reduced number of features through PCA and t-SNE, preserving 90% of the explained variance in dimensionality reduction.

### Cluster Analysis with K-Means:
* Create an elbow plot to determine the best number of clusters.

## Recommendation

* Based on your findings, make a brief (1-2 sentences) recommendation to your clients. Can the cryptocurrencies be clustered together? If so, into how many clusters?
